h1. PeepCode CouchDB Sample Code

This is sample code from the "PeepCode Screencast on CouchDB":http://peepcode.com/products/couchdb-with-rails. Buy the screencast for only US$9 to learn how it works, plus a bunch more about CouchDB.

Use at your own risk. 

See the "v1-start":http://github.com/topfunky/peepcode-couchdb-code/tree/v1-start branch for the basic application starting point.

Feel free to fork and send back patches.
